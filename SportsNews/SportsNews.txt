IPL 2022: RR vs RCB | Plucky Karthik and Shahbaz pull off a heist against the Royals

Royal Challengers duo swings the match with a brilliant 67-run stand for the sixth wicket; Buttler’s knock and Chahal’s superb spell go in vain for Rajasthan
Just when Yuzvendra Chahal seemed to have broken the back of his former franchise, Dinesh Karthik produced a memorable blitzkrieg to inflict a stunning four-wicket defeat on Rajasthan Royals at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday.

Chasing Royals’ 169 for three, Royal Challengers Bangalore was staring at defeat after losing the top five wickets in the space of 32 runs. What followed was a Karthik-inspired 67-run stand off 32 balls with left-handed Shahbaz Ahmed and turned the match on its head.

Karthik’s unbeaten 23-ball 44 and Shahbaz’s 26-ball 45 set up Royal Challengers’ second straight win and Royals’ first loss in three games. Between them, these batters struck four sixes and 11 fours to leave Royals bleeding.
