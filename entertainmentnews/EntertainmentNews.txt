Will Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt's wedding be held at Ranbir's Vastu house in Bandra and not RK Bungalow?It's all happening in the Kapoor khandaan. Fun, excitement and celebration, albeit quiet so far, has reached feverish pitch. As Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt get ready to marry next week, earlier in the day we brought you exclusive details of Ranbir having booked the banquet of his building Vastu in Pali Hill for 8 days.This has made us wonder if the wedding is now happening at Vastu, where Alia also stays in a separate flat on 5th floor, since 2019. Ranbir stays in a penthouse in Vastu, which is just four or five blocks away from Krishna Raj, which is under renovation and expected to be ready next year. A source says, "Ranbir booked the same banquet for 4 days sometime in 2019, around the time Alia got her house on 5th floor on rent - but used it for just 1 or 2 days that time. We will have to wait and see what exactly pans out in Vastu's banquet this time, from Saturday."

co-star Shahid Kapoor has reacted to the reports of their wedding. The actor told a news portal that he wishes them for their new phasae of their life and wish them a beauiful baby in upcoming months.
